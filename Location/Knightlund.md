Was a province protected by [[Loren Soth]], but was inevitably destroyed in the wake of [[the Cataclysm]]

During a scouting mission, in [[Sessions#Session 9|Session 9]] we spotted movement around a castle in the now called Nightlund. I highly suspect this to be [[Dargaard Keep]] and for the armies of [[Takhisis]] to have taken refuge there.
