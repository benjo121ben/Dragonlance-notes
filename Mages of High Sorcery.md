#Faction 

Many magic-users on Krynn are members of an ancient organization known as the Mages of High Sorcery. Predominantly composed of wizards—with a lesser number of sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters—members are divided into three orders. Each order dedicates itself to virtues extolled by a god of magic and honors the moon its deity is associated with. The three orders cooperate as part of a single organization, overseen by a council of experienced members known as the Conclave. Equally devoted to the study of magic and united in defending their knowledge and traditions, the three orders differ in their fundamental reasons for using magic. 

# The Orders
## Order of the White Robes 
Dedicated to the good god Solinari, the White Robes accept the solemn responsibility of using magic only to **make the world a better place**. The path they walk is a narrow one, and almost daily, a mage of the White Robes faces the agonizing decision of whether to intervene in the affairs of others for the greater good. 

## Order of the Red Robes
Inspired by the neutral god Lunitari, the Red Robes help others when it suits them and use their gifts for their own enrichment as they desire. Mages of the Red Robes are expected to **wield their power responsibly**, represent their order faithfully, and uphold the balance between good and evil in their own actions and the world at large. 

## Order of the Black Robes
Often reviled and feared in equal measure, the Black Robes follow the example of the evil god Nuitari, the black moon of Krynn. A mage of the Black Robes is expected to **first further their own ambitions**, then pursue the goals of their order, and then support the continued well-being of the Conclave.

# Towers of High Sorcery 
Thousands of years ago, the Mages of High Sorcery cooperated to build **five Towers of High Sorcery**, centers of learning to advance the craft of magic and the interests of the orders. Three of the towers were destroyed during the Cataclysm, and a fourth—the once unsurpassed Tower of Palanthas—lies cursed and empty. The only tower remaining in operation, the Tower of Wayreth, now serves as headquarters of the Mages of High Sorcery and repository of their greatest secrets. 

# The Test of High Sorcery 
An apprentice mage who seeks to join one of the three orders must first pass a trial known as the Test of High Sorcery. Every mage's test is different, tailored to both the order they wish to join and their own personal challenges and aspirations. Nonetheless, a few elements are always present. 
## Lethal Failure
The primary purpose of the test is to weed out those who would misuse magic. Every test is designed so failure means death. There is no judge, no score, and little chance of surviving a failed test. 
## Magical Acumen
A mage must wield magic with competence, creativity, and control. Every test requires a mage to use the most advanced magic they've learned—and, sometimes, to push beyond it. 

## Test of Character
The mages of the Conclave need to know the apprentice will honor the laws of their order, no matter the circumstance. To this end, the test confronts an apprentice with bitter moral and emotional choices as well as magical challenges. 

## Illusion and Reality
Friends, enemies, and loved ones might appear in the test, along with all manner of hazards and puzzles. The applicant has no way of knowing which challenges are illusory and which are real. In some cases, the test has lasting consequences for an applicant's life beyond the order. 

# Renegade Mages
If a spellcaster leaves or is thrown out of the Mages of High Sorcery, or they fail the Test of High Sorcery and survive, the organization's leaders forbid them from continuing to practice magic. Mages who practice magic in defiance of the Conclave are deemed renegades. Members of the robed orders are duty-bound to report and oppose such renegades. Some order members hunt renegades, seeking to punish or slay those who've defied the Mages of High Sorcery.

ich such aber noch antworten zu deinen fragen specifically

# My questions
**Was würden Leute, die nicht zu den Magiern gehören, Interessantes über sie wissen?** nicht viel konkretes, magier sind als geheimnisvoll, mächtig und gefährlich angesehen und viele trauen sich nichtmal das zu hinterfragen was sie tun. sicher ein haufen gerüchte that might or might not be true tho. "ein magier hat die cousine meiner schwägerin in eine kröte verwandelt"

**Was machen die den ganzen Tag?** kommt ein bisschen auf die order an, white robes vermutlich so in richtung forschung für gute zwecke, helfen, beraten. red robes ihre eigenen forschungen nachgehen, viel reisen. black robes ihre persönlichen ziele, experimente for more sinister purposes and power. allgemein halt sammeln neues wissens, finden neuer zauber, etc

**Traveln die auch, oder sind sie oft mehr an einer Location?** mal so, mal so, aber tendenziell kann ich mir vorstellen dass red/black robes mehr reisen. und suchen magischer artefakte is immer ein guter grund wohin zu gehen

**Machen die viel Research?** yes, see above. da magie relativ selten ist, gibts nicht einfach magie schule xy, alle sammeln sich so ein bisschen selber ihr research zusammen.

**Wie interagieren sie mit Communities um sie herum?** die weißen evtl noch als berater, aber ansich sind sie meistens sehr für sich.

**Gibts da eine hierarchy?** => **The Conclave** The Wizards were formed into three orders and originally overseen by The Council of Three, who then chose one of themselves to act as Highmage. This was the beginning of the Conclave of Wizards. However, this caused considerable dissent among the Black Robes, who were routinely passed over for the title of Highmage. Disgruntled, the Black Robes threatened to leave and create their own towers. In the end, a compromise was made to avoid the Conclave being weakened with the loss of the Black Robes and the Conclave was restructured to create a more fair and balanced process for the selection of Highmage. All Towers of High Sorcery would choose three representatives, one from each Tower, creating 5 total from each of the orders. From these five, a Master of that order would be elected, and of those three Masters, a Highmage would be selected. This was known as the Council of Fifteen.

**Wie genau handlen die den fact dass manche members evil sind und manche good** das konzept von gleichgewicht steht über moral. wo es gütige und selbstlose magier gibt, gibt es auch die die nur aus eigeninteresse und aus suche nach macht handeln. missbrauch von magie und willkürlliches töten von magiern ist trotzdem nicht gern gesehen. aber es gibt sicher auch mehr als genug unterschwellige konflikte innerhalb der magier.

**Sind die mehr operatives für das "council of high sorcery" wenns sowas gibt, oder machen die so generell ihren eigenen shit most of the time und werden nur grob überwacht?** ich stell mir das ein bisschen wie eine verpflichtende vereinsmitgliedschaft vor du kannst sie mostly ignorieren und dein ding machen abseits vom absoluten mindestmaß (also halt den test of high sorcery machen), aber wenn du dich reinziehen lässt, bekommst du sicher mehr als genug aufgaben. und je mehr man sich involviert, desto mehr ressourcen sind sie auch willing dir zu geben für deine ziele

**From the very beginning, there were essentially three principles that guided the original mages of the Towers:** All wizards were brothers and sisters in their order and all orders were brothers and sisters in magic The Towers belonged to all mages of all orders and no magic was to be used in anger against another member in the Towers Outside the Towers, fate often made enemies of mages of the Orders, but this was considered a natural part of the world
